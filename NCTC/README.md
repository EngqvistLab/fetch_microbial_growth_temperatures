# Scripts to retrieve growth temperature data from NCTC
A complete list of identifiers and strain names were obtained directly from NCTC (personal communication). These were exported as a tab-delimited file and then read into python. The numbers were used to fetch all the strain html pages.
These pages were then parsed to get the growth temperature, risk class, isolation source and type of organism.
