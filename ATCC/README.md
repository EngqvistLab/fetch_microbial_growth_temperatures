# Scripts to retrieve growth temperature data from ATCC
ATCC make it very difficult to get their organism data. In a first step some clever URL hacking is used to download lists of all their organisms in batches of 100. In a second step those lists are used to build the URL for individual strains and download the html pages. The scripts target all stocks from the "protozoa and algae", "fungi and yeast" and "bacteria and phages" databases at ATCC. If a temperature span was given for the growth then the average was computed and stored. If room temp was given as growth temp then 21C was stored.
