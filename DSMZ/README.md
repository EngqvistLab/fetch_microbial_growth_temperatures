I used to have a script used to go go through all DSM numbers up to 14859 and downloads the html file.
However, this was a bad strategy as there turns out to be many entries above 14859.

Now the scripts go through the numbers from a file sent to me by DSMZ.
I can parse out most of the information I want from that file.
However, to make sure I have access to all info I also download the html files and parse those.
